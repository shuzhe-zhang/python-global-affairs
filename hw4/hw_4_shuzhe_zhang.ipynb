    "\n",
    "Python classes are a fundamental part of object-oriented programming (OOP), allowing for the encapsulation of data and functions that operate on that data in a single entity, known as an object. What does that mean? It means you can create code that can put a nice package around all of the functions you're writing so that they are neat, tidy and not strewn all about the place. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of global affairs, Python classes can be used to model complex entities and relationships found in international relations, economics, environmental studies, and more. By defining classes, you can create more organized, scalable, and reusable code for analyses, simulations, data processing and visualization.\n",

    "Attribute: A variable that belongs to an object or class. In the context of global affairs, an attribute could represent data like a country's GDP, population, or carbon emissions.\n",
