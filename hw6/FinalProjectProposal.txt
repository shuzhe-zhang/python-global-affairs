**Research Proposal: Designing an Interactive Tool for Literature Reviews of American Economic Review Papers**

**Objective:**
The aim of this project is to develop a Python-based tool to streamline and enhance the literature review process for economists, specifically focusing on papers published in the prestigious journal, American Economic Review (AER). The tool will provide users with an efficient means of accessing and analyzing relevant information from AER papers within a specified timeframe.

**Proposed Approach:**

1. **Web Scraping of AER Data:**
   - Utilize web scraping techniques to gather information such as authors, abstracts, keywords, publication dates, and journal titles from AER papers published within a defined 5-year period.

2. **Dashboard Displaying Patterns and Trends:**
   - Develop a visually appealing dashboard using Python libraries such as Plotly or Dash. This dashboard will offer users an overview of patterns, trends, and key insights from the collected AER papers, aiding in identifying the latest research directions.

3. **Text Analysis and Search Functionality:**
   - Implement text analysis and word embeddings to enable users to input their research topic or field of interest. The tool will search the AER database for relevant papers, returning results based on similarity in abstract content, keywords, or other attributes.

4. **Information Retrieval and Citation Generation:**
   - Design algorithms using machine learning or natural language processing to extract pertinent details from identified AER papers. These details will include abstracts, datasets used, empirical strategies employed, author information, journal names, and citation formatting.

5. **Output Organization and Categorization:**
   - Compile the extracted information into a structured spreadsheet format, facilitating systematic categorization and comparison of papers related to the user's research interest.

**Feasibility of Dashboard Implementation:**
- To create an interactive dashboard, leveraging libraries like Plotly or Dash can be highly effective. Dash, being a user-friendly web application framework for Python, allows for the construction of interactive and customizable data visualization interfaces quickly. Additionally, incorporating CSS styling and responsive design principles will enhance the overall user experience.

**Conclusion:**
By employing a combination of web scraping, text analysis, machine learning, and data visualization techniques, this proposed tool will empower economists to efficiently navigate the vast landscape of AER publications and derive valuable insights for their research endeavors.
