Title: Proposal for Designing a Tool for Literature Review for American Economic Review Papers

Objective:
The goal of this project is to build a Python tool that assists economists in conducting literature reviews for papers published in the top economics journal, American Economic Review. By leveraging techniques like web scraping, text analysis, and machine learning, the tool will provide users with a streamlined process for accessing relevant research papers, identifying trends, and extracting key information for their own research.

Methodology:
1. Web Scraping: Develop a web scraping module to extract information such as authors, abstracts, keywords, and publication details for papers published in the American Economic Review within a specified timeframe.

2. Data Dashboard: Construct a user-friendly dashboard using libraries like Plotly or Dash to visualize patterns, trends, and insights from the scraped papers. This will offer users a quick overview of the most recent research trends in the journal.

3. Text Analysis: Implement text analysis techniques like Natural Language Processing (NLP) and word embeddings to enable users to enter specific research topics or fields of interest. The tool will then search the database to find related papers and provide relevant information such as abstracts, datasets used, empirical strategies, author details, and journal names.

4. Machine Learning: Explore the possibility of applying machine learning algorithms for improved paper categorization and recommendation based on user input and preferences.

5. Output Generation: Generate a structured spreadsheet containing all the extracted information, facilitating easy categorization and comparison of the papers.

Building the Dashboard:
- Approach: Utilize the Plotly library in Python to create interactive and visually appealing plots and charts for displaying trends and insights from the literature database.
- Design: Focus on creating a clean and intuitive interface with dropdown menus for topic selection, search bars for query input, and dynamic graphs for displaying trends and patterns.
- Functionality: Ensure the dashboard allows users to interact with the data, filter results based on criteria, and easily access detailed information for selected papers.

In conclusion, this project will empower economists with a robust tool for efficiently conducting literature reviews, staying updated on the latest research trends, and extracting valuable insights for their own research endeavors.
