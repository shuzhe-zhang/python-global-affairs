      "reach or exceed human-level performance. This suggests that we will need to develop techniques that do not\n",
      "rely on humans to supervise all aspects of AI behavior, and that can be used to automatically test and enhance\n",
      "robustness to harmful behaviors. We also aim to develop methods that encode desirable AI behavior in a\n",
      "simple and transparent form, and that make it easier to understand and evaluate AI decision making.\n",
      "In this paper we develop a method we refer to as Constitutional AI (CAI), depicted in Figure 1, and use it\n",
      "to train a non-evasive and relatively harmless AI assistant, without any human feedback labels for harms .\n",
      "The method therefore improves upon, and partially replaces reinforcement learning from human feedback\n",

      "previously collected [Bai et al., 2022, Ganguli et al., 2022] human feedback labels for harmfulness. We chose\n",

      "of a short list of principles or instructions, i.e. a constitution. But we are also employing this terminology to\n",
      "emphasize that when developing and deploying a general AI system, we cannot avoid choosing some set of\n",
      "principles to govern it, even if they remain hidden or implicit.\n",
      "Our motivations for developing this technique were: (1) to study simple possibilities for using AI systems to\n",

      "• AI systems can already perform some tasks at or beyond human level (e.g. [Silver et al., 2017]),\n",

      "provide oversight for these powerful AI systems, and scaling supervision may be one possibility, if\n",
      "the capability level of the supervisor can scale proportionally with the capabilities of the actor, and\n",
      "the supervisor remains aligned with our intended goals and constraints.\n",

      "In prior work we have focused on training AI assistants to helpful, harmless, and honest [Askell et al., 2021],\n",
      "but otherwise we have allowed their behavior to be determined by generalization patterns from pretraining\n",
      "that are not under our direct control.\n",
      "However, the constitutional methods we have discussed here are very general, and in principle might be\n",
      "applied to steer language models in a variety of ways. For example, we expect we could use these method to\n",
      "change the model’s writing style, tone, or personality, or alter its responses to speciﬁc categories of questions\n",
      "(e.g. to train an AI that heavily caveats certain categories of advice, or that adopts a speciﬁc persona). The\n",
      "constitutional approach should thus make it much easier to study how different AI behaviors tend to generalize\n",
      "and interfere, since by obviating human feedback, our methods lower the barrier to experimentation. For\n",
      "example, it should be possible to generate feedback labels along dozens of behavioral axes, and then study\n",
      "how preference models trained from these labels are correlated or anti-correlated. This is important for AI\n",
      "safety, since the generalization patterns imbued by pretraining are currently something of a black box whose\n",
      "correlations may have unforeseen consequences.\n",
      "Another remaining issue, and a major motivation for this work, is robustness —that is, can we make models\n",
      "essentially immune to red-team attacks? We hope that by making helpfulness and harmlessness more com-\n",
      "patible, we will be able to signiﬁcantly scale-up (automated) red teaming in order to improve robustness.\n",
      "Furthermore, we should be able to perform iterated ‘online’ training [Bai et al., 2022] with AI supervision,\n",
      "15where we update the preference model with new AI feedback in order to keep it on the same distribution as\n",
      "the policy produces. We saw that this was valuable with human feedback, and by using AI feedback we can\n",

    "Sample Progress Note Patient report of recent symptoms/behaviors: (R/T DX & TX Plan) Jill denied any suicidal ideation in the past week. She reported that she still feels sad most of the time. She got an “F” on another math test this week. She expressed frustration with math. She was tearful as she talked about feeling dumb and feeling like she will never understand it. However, she reported that when she got the “F” her father was more understanding, did not lecture her or ground her further. Session Note: (include therapist clinical intervention & patient response) This session focused on Treatment Plan Problem 1, Goals 2 (adding an extracurricular activity) and 4 (learn coping skills and emotional regulation). We discussed her recent participation in a Church of Christ in youth group service day at the Altoona Humane Society. This writer encouraged Jill to share some of her interests in order to identify additional activities she could become involved in. Jill’s affect brightened as she discussed playing basketball when she lived in Texas. Jill was encouraged to find out from her school what she would need to do to play basketball here. She is to report on this in the next session. Most of this session focused on beginning to assess Jill’s abilities to label, modulate, appropriately express and cope with feelings. Jill was asked to brainstorm all the names of feelings she can. She listed 26 feelings. Jill then was asked to share times she had experienced the feelings. This activity assesses how aware Jill is of her feelings and works on being able to verbalize feelings to others. Jill indicated that she does not like to talk about her feelings. She was reluctant to talk about times she felt negative feelings, such as guilty, lonely, overwhelmed, disappointed and unloved. We explored why it is hard for her to share feelings. She indicated that it is hard for her to trust others and she doesn’t feel like people understand. We explored ways she currently uses to express feelings. Jill indicated that she likes to write, especially poetry. Jill was given a handout listing 50 feeling names to help her learn to differentiate and accurately label feelings. She was given the homework assignment of writing a poem about any feeling she has this week and bringing it to her to the next individual therapy session. Patient progress towards treatment plan goal(s): Jill reported that her father Ed responded in a more understanding way when she recently got another “F” on a math test (Problem 2, Goal 3). Ed even asked Jill if she’d like a part time job at his business Spratts Used Furniture Depot. Jill said she’d rather work at Tuna Altoona a local fishmarket but is worried that they don’t hire women, because she’d be the only one working there who wasn’t a man. Jill began to work on emotional regulation. (Problem 1, Goal 4). She can identify many of her feelings, but is reluctant to share negative feelings with others. This goal still needs quite a bit of work. \n",

    "Notice that there is a lot of advice in this prompt about how to search Wikipedia properly. We're all used to just typing random nonsense into Google and getting decent results because the query parsing logic is so good. Wikipedia search is not like that. As an example: consider the query \"What's the best way to purchase potatoes in the United Arab Emirates\". The top hits for this on Wikipedia are for Slavery in the United States, 1973 Oil Crisis, Wendy's, and Tim Horton's (??). Meanwhile Google correctly takes you straight to Carrefour UAE.\n",

    "Another difference is that Wikipedia search returns entire pages. With vector search, you might be getting narrower chunks, so you might want to ask for more results, use a more specific query, or both.
